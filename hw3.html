  <br>
  Has Cryptocurrency really affected the world as much as we think? We looked at the gold standard
  as a measure
  <br>
   to tell the effect of Bitcoin in the past several years. While cryptocurrency has grown,  the gold prices remained 
  <br>
  relatively stable and fluctuated more when cryptocurrency  was not as highly valued. The y-axis is the log of the
  <br>
  USD value of the currency at the date in time.
